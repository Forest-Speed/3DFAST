DMD Calibration and TI 

Step 1: 

-Use  highlighter slide!

-upload calibration mask -> users/researcher/3DFAST-main/3DFAST-main -> upload_DMD_calibration.py

-take photo with FULL Frame in ArenaView (should see dots!), re-upload if not

-save photo in users/researcher/mcSIM/examples/data

Step 2: 

-Open Affine xform script-> users/researcher/mcSIM/examples -> calibrate_affine_xform_ATLAS10.py

-Change lines for image_fname to photo from earlier (30?)

-Update centers_init values 
	in Fiji: -open photo from step 1 as well as users/reasearcher/3dfast-main/3dfast-main -> Dot_Calibration_Photo.jpg ???? -> McSIM/examples/Data -> calibration_dot_indices.png !
		 -find center of 6 each dots in the new photo that are labeled 1-6 in the calibration photo 
		 -update values for centers_init with these center points -> MUST BE IN CORRECT ORDER OF DOT CALIBRATION PHOTO!!! Y/X REVERSED!

- run calilbrate_affine_xform_ATLAS10.py

Step 3: 

-Switch to real Sample!

-Open users/researcher/mcSIM/examples/convert_ATLAS10_to_DMD.py

-Switch save_dir variable to folder created in step 2 

-Use ArenaView GUi to take photo of full sample FOV, save in users/researcher/mcSIM/examples 

-Update draw_reactangle_with_drag and test_path values to the name used with the full FOV frame just taken 

-Run convert_ATLAS10_to_DMD.py 

-Draw box around target in CV2 GUI that pops up. 

-Watch selective target illumination in ArenaView

-Change ArenaView parameters and record.. or whatever !!!
